Zoo Gas is an educational game that attempts to pose a familiar question in computational ecology -- how are complex food webs stabilized? -- as a real-time game mechanic.

Formally, it is an experimental entropy-maximizing, population-balancing and breeding game set on a cellular automaton model of the Lotka-Volterra equation.

The underlying engine is a general-purpose, peer-to-peer reaction-diffusion simulator.

Zoo Gas is open source: all code is available, including code of past prototypes.

The latest prototype can be found in the 'current' directory.
Enter that directory and type "make zoogas" to run it.

Older, working but simpler prototypes can be found in the 'prototypes' directory.
